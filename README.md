👋 Hey there! I'm Stex, a passionate coder on 
a journey to explore the world of software development.

🖥️ I've been coding for a year now, and it's been an exhilarating experience. 
I primarily work with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python, constantly honing my skills and seeking new challenges.

💡 My journey into the world of programming began with a curiosity to understand how websites are built. 
Since then, I've delved deep into front-end development, mastering the art of crafting engaging user interfaces with HTML and CSS, 
while bringing them to life with the dynamic capabilities of JavaScript. 
Additionally, I've dived into the world of backend development with Python, 
exploring its versatility and power in building robust server-side applications.

🚀 I'm enthusiastic about leveraging technology to solve real-world problems and am always eager to collaborate on exciting projects that push the boundaries of innovation.
